Full-Stack Web Development Node.js Understanding Version Control, Git, &amp; GitHub Markdown &amp; Documentation
## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Full-Stack Web Development

Full-stack web development involves both front-end and back-end developing techniques. Prior to this course, I have only worked with front-end developing, and more so html and css in my day-today job. We will be using _node.js_ in this course to learn back-end development. Full-stack developers are ighly needed for their understanding of both the back-end functionality and front-end aesthetics of an application or website.

### Node.js Understanding

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows for back-end devlopment. It allows back-end developers to use and change _JavaScript_ code in the server environment. A key feature of Node.js is it's ability to use non-blocking I/O, which means it can handle multiple requests and does not need to rely on finishing the previous request.

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

Version control allows a user to see how many times the code was updated or changed by anyone who is accessing the project. This also allows for developers to recall previous versions if needed. Git & Github allow for code written in a code editor to sit live in a public space. 

### Markdown & Documentation

Markdown Language allows for styling techniques to be used with plain text HTML files that will affect the visual aesthetics. Like _Italic_ or **Bold** text. It's important to document and add comments to all your code to explain to other developers your mindset and resoing behind creating the project you have.
